description: Explore observed climate extremes, and learn about the research into them.
---
I produced two websites for the recent ARCCSS Showcase. One of those was [Explore Climdex](https://exploreclimdex.org), a site designed to allow people to either explore our massive datasets of climate extremes on their own or to be walked through interesting aspects of extremes research in a guided way.

I've written about [some of the design decisions](http://climateextremes.org.au/arccss-showcase-projects/) behind this project, as well as [some of the technical challenges](https://medium.com/@rensa/challenges-visualising-climate-extremes-with-leaflet-7a407162d75f). I'm now working to integrate this functionality into a new version of the [Climdex website](https://climdex.org).
