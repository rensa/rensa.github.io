Does what it says on the tin: is it hot (in Sydney) right now? Built by Mat Lipson, Steefan Contractor and me over a few weekend, this web app compares today's temperature in Sydney to 150 years of observations and give you an idea of just how unsuaully hot it is.

We have a few priorities for expansion:

- Expanding to more locations,
- Better explaining a station's history, including hardware and location changes, and
- Visualisaing the role of climate change.
