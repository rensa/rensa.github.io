description: A package for plotting country flags as bubbles or balloons in ggplot.
---
I've taken over development of ggflags, an extension to ggplot2 that allows you to plot country flags as points or bubbles. The original was developed by  [Baptiste's Augui√©](https://github.com/baptiste/ggflags), and I've so far extended it to use round, vector flags from the [EmojiOne v2](https://www.emojione.com/) set (so they'll look great at any size).

We're currently working on SVG export for interactive graphics. It works with `ggsave` if you have the `svglite` package installed, although you lose the structure of the plot, which isn't great for interactive applications. `gridSVG::grid.export` also works, although you'll have to do some manual tweaking of the output to correct for a bug with the viewport.

Further out, I'd like to develop this into a package for plotting arbitrary SVG icons!
