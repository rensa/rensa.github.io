Small update to the CCRC weather station! I mean, I'm pretty happy with it, but the end result is physically small: the timelapse videos now have timestamps. The reason is that it's storm season in Sydney at the moment, and the videos coming out of the weather station are getting a lot of attention. A pair of videos of a recent storm picked up about 21 000 views between them:

I'd like a bit more of the benefit of that to go back to the CCRC—but as well as that, it would be useful to see how quickly time is moving during the shot, as the night shots have long exposures and hence run at a different speed to the day ones.

I had a few requirements, though. I wanted to be able to do this:

- using the existing image series, which is stored within a base directory using a `/images/YYYY-MM-DD/HH/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-SS.jpg` structure, and
- without preprocessing the images (ie. altering the original images or making copies of them).

Basically, I was being stubborn about this because I thought `ffmpeg` should be able to handle it.

The existing code (which is [now on Github](https://github.com/rensa/ccrc-weather-station-uploads)—I'm working on getting the code that sits on the station itself up at a later date) already uses [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to stitch the image sequence together. Because the images aren't taken at regular intervals (though the station tries very hard), this script uses ffmpeg's concat filter, which accepts a list of image paths, to render the video. Originally, that file list looked like this (but with absolute paths):

{% highlight shell linenos=table %}
file 'images/2016-01-31/06/2016-01-31-0630-37.jpg'
file 'images/2016-01-31/06/2016-01-31-0630-41.jpg'
file 'images/2016-01-31/06/2016-01-31-0630-44.jpg'
{% endhighlight %}

But the concat filter can also be used to pass other custom frame metadata, like:

{% highlight shell linenos=table %}
file 'images/2016-01-31/06/2016-01-31-0630-37.jpg'
file_packet_metadata dt=2016-01-31-0630-37
file 'images/2016-01-31/06/2016-01-31-0630-41.jpg'
file_packet_metadata dt=2016-01-31-0630-41
file 'images/2016-01-31/06/2016-01-31-0630-44.jpg'
file_packet_metadata dt=2016-01-31-0630-44
{% endhighlight %}

And _that_ metadata can be accessed by subsequent filters. For example, in the weather station script, we use the shell's `find` to build up the list of images, then loop through the list to add the metadata (which is essentially just the date-time used in the file name). Finally, `ffmpeg`'s `drawtext` filter access this using `text='%{metadata\\:dt}`, where `dt` is the metadata key we've specified. [This](https://github.com/rensa/ccrc-weather-station-uploads/blob/master/custom-youtube.sh) is how it comes together:

{% highlight shell linenos=table %}
# get the list of files in the matching date-time range
find "$DATA_DIR"/images -type f -mmin -"$VID_START" -mmin +"$VID_END" >custom-list.txt

# transform file list to prep for ffmpeg (including adding metadata)line-by-line
IMG_PATH="$DATA_DIR"/images
EXT=".jpg"
while read FULLNAME; do
    # extract date-time part of filename
    if [[ $FULLNAME =~ [0-9]{4}.[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{2}.[0-9]{4}.[0-9]{2} ]]; then
        DT="${BASH_REMATCH[0]}"
    fi

    printf "file \'$FULLNAME\'\nfile_packet_metadata dt=$DT\n" >>custom-list2.txt
done <custom-list.txt
mv custom-list2.txt custom-list.txt

# render the video
nice -n 20 ffmpeg/ffmpeg -threads 6 -f concat -r "$FRAME_RATE" \
    -i custom-list.txt \
    -i waltz-flowers-tchaikovsky.mp3 \
    -threads 6 \
    -vf "crop=2592:1458:0:450, \
        drawtext=fontfile=RobotoCondensed-Italic.ttf:\
            fontsize=48:\
            fontcolor=0xFFFFFF:\
            shadowcolor=0x00000088:\
            shadowx=5:\
            shadowy=5:\
            text='%{metadata\\:dt}':\
            x=20:\
            y=h-32-106-th, \
        drawtext=fontfile=RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf:\
            fontsize=48:\
            fontcolor=0xFFFFFF:\
            shadowcolor=0x00000088:\
            shadowx=5:\
            shadowy=5:\
            text='Climate Change Research Centre':\
            x=20:\
            y=h-32-48-th, \
        drawtext=fontfile=RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf:\
            fontsize=48:\
            fontcolor=0xFFFFFF:\
            shadowcolor=0x00000088:\
            shadowx=5:\
            shadowy=5:\
            text='Sydney, Australia':\
            x=20:\
            y=h-32-th" \
    -shortest "$DATA_DIR"/videos/custom-"$TODAY.mov"
{% endhighlight %}

The result works really well:
