The Climate Health Partnership is a collaboration between the Faculty of Science and Faculty of Health at UNSW. We are an interdisciplinary team of scientists who have formed a partnership to investigate the relationships between climate change and human health.

I've developed the website in collaboration with [Donna Green](https://donnagreen.org/) of the [CCRC](http://ccrc.unsw.edu.au).
